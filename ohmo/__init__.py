"""ohmo personal agent app built on top of OpenHarness.

Integration: This ohmo module specializes the reusable OpenHarness runtime with personal
workspace, memory, session, gateway, or channel behavior; core modules must not depend on it.

Concurrency: This module is synchronous unless collaborators document otherwise; async callers
execute its helpers inline, so filesystem, process, parsing, and serialization work must remain
bounded.

Change safety: Preserve the ohmo workspace boundary, conversation/session isolation, attachment
and channel contracts, credential redaction, and cleanup of per-session runtimes.
