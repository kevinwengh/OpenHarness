"""String-based file editing tool.

Integration: This module participates in model-callable tools registered with the shared engine
governance path.

Event loop: Coroutines and async generators execute on their caller's loop; preserve
cancellation, ordering, task ownership, bounded synchronous work, and cleanup of every acquired
resource.

Change safety: Preserve Pydantic schemas, async ToolResult behavior, read-only policy,
context.cwd, hooks, sandboxing, output bounds, and registration.
